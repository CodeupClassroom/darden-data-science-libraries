    "### Histograms\n",
    "\n",
    "- Histograms are often used in the data prep stage of the pipeline. \n",
    "- They are good for the discovery of a single variable\n",
    "    - the distribution - skewed right or left, normally distributed ('bell curve'), uniformly distributed, etc. \n",
    "    - the range of values - wide or narrow range? can values be < 0? what is the max value? \n",
    "    - outliers - true outliers? data errors? \n",
    "- Box plots are often used for these types of discoveries, also. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Line & Scatterplots\n",
    "\n",
    "- Line & scatter plots, as well as bar plots, and many, many others, are most commonly used for exploring the relationships between variables, and, as you would expect, are used in the exploration stage of the pipeline.  \n",
    "- Line & Scatter Plots are used when your x and y variables are both numeric and ordered, while bar plots are used when you have one numeric and one categorical variable. \n",
    "- Color can be added on any of these as a third dimension, and one that represents a categorical variable. It can be used to create multiple lines representing categories or classes, or to identify points on a scatterplot as belonging to one category or class.   \n",
    "- Size can be added as a third (or fourth) dimension to scatter plots to represent a numeric or ordered variable.  \n",
    "- Line is best when x represents time.   \n",
    "- Scatter is best when x is numeric, but doesn't represent time.   \n",
